## What we do:
```
One of our main job responsibilities is to be "liaisons" to various departments at UVA. Basically this means, 
if there is some resource the department needs and the library can provide it, it is our job to make that happen. 
This could be one of many things:
    * Scholarly resources like journals, databases, data, and sometimes even books!
    * "Expert" advice on how to go about scholarly research
    * Technical Support for various softwares, statistics, etc...
    * physical space for events, studying, exhibits
    * technology like makerspace related things
```

## UVA Libraries
There are actually 11 libraries around grounds and that includes 3 that are not technically a part of the 
"UVA Libraries" organization. The law school, business school, and health science library are technically 
not affiliated with us.

### UVA Libraries during covid
```
At the moment only two of our physical buildings are open, Clemons and Brown Libraries, and we have a limited 
number of staff and capacity for patrons. Library hours [can be found here](https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours).
Also, our Main library (formerly Alderman Library) is being renovated.

# Your Final Project

Here is what you need for writing your final project:
```
* A peer reviewed scientific journal article 
* At least one source related to: 
  * natural science
  * humanities
  * social science
* At least one government/agency source
```


## Finding peer reviewed scholarly articles

### My preferred strategy (Erich)
Google makes things easy to use. Luckily they have created [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)

#### How to set up Google Scholar
1. If you are not on grounds, go here: [https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/).
2. In the top left corner choose the three horizonal lines
3. Choose "settings"
4. On the left choose "Library Links"
5. In the search box type in "University of Virginia Libraries" and check the box

Now, you can browse for articles in basically the same way you would for a normal google search.

#### Helpful Google Scholar Tricks
If you find an article(s) that might be good for you paper, you can easily find similar results.
